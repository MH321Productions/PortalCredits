PortalCredits is a small tribute to the PORTAL game series by Valve,
created by a bored university student in his free time.
It recreates the end credits of the first PORTAL game with the Song
"Still Alive" by Jonathan Coulton.
 
 
                I don't own the song, its lyrics,
                the credits or the symbols, Valve does.
